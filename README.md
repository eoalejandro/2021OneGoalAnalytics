# 2021OneGoalAnalytics

Dear DSSG Selection Committee,

Please find here the data related projects requested for your review.  The following briefly describes the project and its intended outcome.


# Project Specification



# Intended Outcome

 I anticipate a OneGoal teacher to use the tool to monitor and track their fellow milestone completion rates and their postsecondary plans.  With Year One deliverables including drafting a best-fit list and setting an ambitious GPA goal, the tool aims to support with action planning one-on-one advising sessions with Fellows.  Specifically, the tool aims to support the prioritization of students who are off-track due to incomplete milestones, or are in need of support given their self-reported goals, e.g. a low gpa goal, missing postsecondary plans, etc.  

Lastly, in considering all the data provided about the “Andy Schmitz” cohort, the following three students should be prioritized in upcoming advising conversations with Mr. Schmitz:
1st period: J. Harmon, J. Roberson, J. Morales
3rd period: J. Murray, D. Taylor, C. Weber
7th period: S. Jensen, N. Oliver, L. Townsend

I chose each trio of fellows per class period because each individual's GPA goal fell below 2.0, yet if I had to prioritize only three students for the day, then it would be Jensen, Oliver, and Murray due to their extremely low GPA goal and either a missing or indecisive postsecondary plan.
I look forward to discussing this tool further.  In the meantime, all the best.

Sincerely,
