# 2021 OneGoal Analytics

Dear DSSG Selection Committee,

Please find here the data related projects requested for your review.  The following briefly describes the project and its intended outcome.

# Overview

What was the goal of the project?  
To create a data-view using a visualization tool of my choice for our OneGoal teachers (Program Directors)to understand their classroom trends, and how their individual students are doing relative to the four milestones tracked by the OneGoal program.

What methods and tools did you use?  
Because the end-user of the work would be a public school teacher, and access to the technology on campus is alway an issue, I went ahead and used Google Suite applications because of their accessibility throughout the district and the familiriaty of use with both staff and faculty.  For this initial dashboard prototype, I use Google Sheets and Google Studios so that teachers could "see" what I was doing with their study data, and feel empowered to do any of the analytics themselves without the need of a coding background. 

Were these projects that you worked on independently, or as part of a team?  
The project was done independently, but judged as the Data Solutions team so that the most promising approach would be piloted.  

What was your role if it was done as part of a team?  
My role was of an individual contributor.  I sought out the opportunity to support with product development so I could apply my learnings in school to a pressing work problem.  

What was the outcome and impact?
I received positive feedback from the team about the prototype's potential. The team lead appreciated the aggregation of the student data on the dashboard and the altitude shared as the top-line headline alongside the student line by line report.  Moreover, they appreciate the partnership approach I took with the assignment as it addressed head-on the needs of our end-user and the orientation towards their use case was solid.  Yet, even though the data used was only a few hundred students, the team lead was seeking a product design to scale. 



# Project Scope & Outcome

Scope:  Create a data-view using a visualization tool of your choice for our OneGoal teachers (Program Directors)to understand their classroom trends, and how their individual students are doing relative to the four milestones above. Feel free to use any of the data provided that you think a Program Director can use to
inform their classroom practice.  Then, in a few sentences, tell how you anticipate the OneGoal Program Director using this tool in their classroom.

Analysis:  I anticipated a OneGoal teacher to use the tool to monitor and track their fellow milestone completion rates and their postsecondary plans.  With Year One deliverables including drafting a best-fit list and setting an ambitious GPA goal, the tool aims to support with action planning one-on-one advising sessions with Fellows.  Specifically, the tool aims to support the prioritization of students who are off-track due to incomplete milestones, or are in need of support given their self-reported goals, e.g. a low gpa goal, missing postsecondary plans, etc.  

Consider all the data you have about students in “Andy Schmitz” cohort. Which three students should Mr.Schmitz prioritize in upcoming advising conversations? Why did you choose those three students?
In considering all the data provided about the “Andy Schmitz” cohort, the following three students should be prioritized in upcoming advising conversations with Mr. Schmitz:
1st period: J. Harmon, J. Roberson, J. Morales
3rd period: J. Murray, D. Taylor, C. Weber
7th period: S. Jensen, N. Oliver, L. Townsend

I chose each trio of fellows per class period because each individual's GPA goal fell below 2.0, yet if I had to prioritize only three students for the day, then it would be Jensen, Oliver, and Murray due to their extremely low GPA goal and either a missing or indecisive postsecondary plan.
